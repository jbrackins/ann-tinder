Any other similarities in name are purely coincidental and are in no relation to the TINDER project and its morals or values.\r\n\r\n# Project Wiki\r\nThe TINDER Wiki can be found [here](https://github.com/jbrackins/ann-tinder/wiki)\r\n\r\n# Repository Access\r\nTINDER is hosted on a private git repository located at [https://github.com/jbrackins/ann-tinder](https://github.com/jbrackins/ann-tinder). To avoid compromising academic integrity, this project repo will remain private until a given point as per professor's request.\r\n\r\n# Downloading TINDER\r\n`git clone https://github.com/jbrackins/ann-tinder.git`\r\n\r\nshould suffice, but if you're stubborn you can always just download the .zip...\r\nTINDER is not available on iPhone or Android, jeez, stop asking....\r\n\r\n# Building TINDER\r\nThe following make scripts can be used for compilation: \r\n\r\n`make` will compile all three executables\r\n\r\n`make ANNtrain` will compile the ANNtrain executable, the program for training the neural net on a given PDSI data set.\r\n\r\n`make ANNtest` will compile the ANNtest executable, the program for testing the neural net to determine fire severity.\r\n\r\n`make CrossValidate` will compile the CrossValidate executable, the program for testing the neural net using cross validation.\r\n\r\n# Running TINDER\r\n`./ANNtrain <parameterfile>`\r\n\r\n`./ANNtest <parameterfile>`\r\n\r\n`./CrossValidate <parameterfile>`\r\n\r\n# Project Members\r\n* **[Julian Brackins](https://github.com/jbrackins)**\r\n* **[Samuel Carroll](https://github.com/samuelcarroll)**\r\n* **[Alex Nienhueser](https://github.com/xlan59)**","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
